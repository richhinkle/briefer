"""NetworkManager (`nmcli`) wrapper for setup mode.

Bookworm ships NetworkManager, which can create a WiFi hotspot and join networks
with a few `nmcli` calls. Everything here degrades safely: if `nmcli` isn't
present (e.g. on a laptop) `available()` is False and the daemon skips setup
mode entirely, just running the scheduler.

These manage NetworkManager (AP + connection changes), which the unprivileged
service account is allowed to do through membership in the `netdev` group — so
no root is needed.
